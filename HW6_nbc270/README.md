HW 6 consists of two parts. The first was work with dataframes in Pandas trying to replicate the lab produced by Dr. Bianco. I did this on my own. 

Part two consisted of SQL-based lab. The goal was to navigate and pull information based on specific SQL statements. 
Though the language of use was SQL, this was done in a Jupyter Notebook. 
I collaborated with Christine Biddlecombe for this part.
