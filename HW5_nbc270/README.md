Part 1:
My review of em3932's citibike proposal is [here](https://github.com/evemarenghi/PUI2018_em3932/blob/master/HW4_em3932/CitibikeReview_nbc270.md)

Part 2: 
Statistical tests in the scientific literature. I collaborated with Ursula Kaczmarek in reviewing papers.

Part 3: 
Reproducing post-prison employment study. Using z-test and chi-squared tests to reproduce results from in-prison program testing. I completed this on my own.

Part 4:
Citibike populations tests of correlation. Determining statistical significance of relationships between day & night Citibike riders. I worked on this on my own.
