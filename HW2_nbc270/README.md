A couple of notes about HW2:
1) For part one of the assignment, the history when I removed the test.csv will not look like my current repo history due to the fact that 
I had to delete and remake my PUI2018 repo due to issues with submodules being uploaded. My HW2 folder became a submodule I couldn't figure
out how to interact with so I deleted the repo, and created a new one. Hence the difference between my screen shots that were taken 
before I deleted that repo, and my current history.

Part one of the assignment iniated with creating a csv file in my HW2_nbc270 folder. This file was then added to my local git, where I used the command provided to remove it from my remote git and any history of it. I did this on my own. 

Part two of the assignment initated with downloading and reading a csv file from NYC Open Data and graphing two numerical values. I chose 
to look at reservoir storage. Storage had no unit provided but is some time of volume. Capacity was determined to be percetage. Graphing the two allowed me to understand the relationship between volume and percent capacity. I did this on my own. 

Part three was taking information from the MTA Bus API and parsing the json file to collect the latitude and longitude of each B52 bus. I was primarily responsible for reading through the API to find specific dictionary and libraries and script writing. I collaborated with Aaron Hill, Eve Marenghi, and Katie Voorhees.

Part four was taking information from the MTA Bus API and parsing the json file to collect the latitude, longitude, stop name, and stop status of each B52 bus. Also required was to find missing data and convert it to N/A and write it out as a CSV. I was primarily responsible for reading through the API to find specific dictionary and libraries and script writing. I collaborated with Aaron Hill, Eve Marenghi, and Katie Voorhees.
