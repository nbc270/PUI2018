HW 4 consists of three files.
Part one displays 11 figures of five distributions and the summation of them. Six of those figures display histograms and five of 
the show figures detailing the law of large numbers. I worked on this on my own with some trouble shooting colaboration with Mingye He and 
Martha Ruth Norrick. 

Part two collects citibike data where I determined the average ride lengths of a men and women during January 2019. The null and 
alternative hypotheses were stated and based on the data, the null was rejected. I worked on this on my own. 

Part three collected the raw data for the ficticious new X8 bus route. Once read in and analyzed, the z-score was computed. The score 
was calculated to be greater than two standard deviations, thus the null was rejected. I worked on this on my own. I colaborated with
Martha Ruth Norrick and Christine Biddlecome with regards to some small troubleshooting.
