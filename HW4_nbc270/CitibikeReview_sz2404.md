## Citibike Review for Nathan Benjamin Caplan (nbc270).


## Hypothesis and Data

### a. verify Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly, and that they are state in both words and formulae (with the proper definitions to accompany the formulae)

The null and alternative hypotheses are formulated clearly to understand. However, I was not able to locate any hypotheses stated in words. 

Based on my understanding of the project, if the expectation is female's trip duration tends to be longer than male's by 10%, both are formulated correctly. 

### b. verify that the data supports the project: i.e. if the a data has the appropriate features (variables) to answer the question, and if the data was properly pre-processed to extract the needed values

The data processing steps are very clear, the necessary data, gender and trip duration are presented and seperated into proper groups for plotting. 

It is a very good idea to convert trip duration from seconds to minutes so it is easier to interpret a bike trip length. In addition, cleaning up the no gender data rows is a very necessary step performed to avoid this category being randomly counted as either gender group. 

### c. chose an appropriate test to test _H0_ given the type of data, and the question asked.

The idea focuses on comparing the means of two groups, female and male riders. I think Student's T can be used for testing to measure the distance/differences between two groups' means and distribution. 

## Comments, Statistical Test, and Suggestions

It is a good idea to compare trip duration between genders. Particularly, during a winter month (in this project January data was selected), dress code, road condition under harsh weather, and physical conditions can affect trip duration. Using the mean for both genders for comparison is interesting and easy to interpret. It would be a good concise statement for quickfact reports.

In addition to Student's T, Z-test can also be performed. The Z-test can compare the mean of female and male groups to all the riders in January (including no gender records). At the same time, visualizing the average trip duration of different duration group might be helpful to contrast the distribution.
