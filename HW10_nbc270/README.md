HW 10 focusses on learning about use of proper models and how to compare said models to find the best fit. In Part one, two models for two
datasets were created and compared their goodness of fit using the LR test. I did this part on my own. 

Part two uses multiple visualizations and tests to determine if models based on lot energy consumption and number units were a better 
goodness of fit for the data. One included plots. Eve Marenghi showed me how to sort the data before creating the models. The next was 
using the chi squared function, showing how residuals and erros showed a goodness of fit. Ursula Kaczmarek helped me in making a chi 
squared function. An LR test and residual infliuence plots were also made to further elaborate which model was best. Besides the sorting 
and chi squared, I did the rest on my own.
