HW 7 was an assignment of five tasks designed for introducing and understanding geopandas. I worked on tasks 1,2,3, and 5 alone. 
I colaborated with Timur Muhtar, on setting up an envrionmental variable for my census API key in ipython and part 3. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: I set my environmental variable for my API key as 'KEY' for part 2. To run this code, you will have to set your API key to
'KEY' as well.
