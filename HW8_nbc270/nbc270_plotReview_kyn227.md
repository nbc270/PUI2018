**CONTENT**

**Clarity, Aesthetic and Accuracy of Representation:** 
The plot is easy to read, and at one glance is able to convey general trends about Number of Prisoners and Stabbing Incidents over the years. 

**Suggestions for improvements:**
Due to the different y-value scales (13000-14600 for number of inmates) and (0-55 for number of stabbing incidents in NYC prisons) i was initially a little confused as to why there were times (eg in 2004) where the number of stabbing incidents in NYC prisons were higher than the number of prisoners. As the intent i believe is to investigate if there is a correlation, or general trend between the number of prisoners and stabbing incidents in NYC prisons, perhaps Nathan can consider using a bar graph with a trend line such as Figure 1.
