Part 1: Creating an image. I created a double y-axis graph detailing number of prisoners and number of stabbing incidents in NYC prisons
over time. Data was collected from NYC Open Data. The figure is seen below. I worked on my own.

Part 2: Performing statistical test on citibike data. I chose not to perform the z-score analysis suggested in sz2404's citibike review. It
suggested doing a z-score analysis, but since I am comparing two means within a population, I elected to do a t-test. I wrote up an
analysis, which can be found [here]. I worked on this on my own.
