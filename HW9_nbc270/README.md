This is my assignment 9 folder. 

Here there will be three parts. Part 1 was writing to review for plots created by ql459 and cl4855. I conducted the review for each one
(labeled as <github handle>_PlotReview_nbc270. I did this on my own.

Part two was to create lines, with various slopes and y intercepts, and perform OLS and WLS regression analysis on them. I did this task 
mostly on my own. I received help from Christine Biddlecombe and Eve Marenghi on getting started with the creating the initial line in 
part one and the ols regression in part 3. 

Part three was to analyze multiple data sets relating to population, GDP, and various gun-related paramters related to different nations. 
For one of the data sets, I could not read it into python in a pythonic manner.
The link to download it is [here](https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/pvLFI/6/)
Once downloaded, plots were rendered of various paramters against each other and OLS, WLS, SNS, and polyfit were applied to the data sets.
In received help from Eve Marenghi for the OLS and WLS portions of the assignment. I aided her in finding how to change the color of an
outlier.
